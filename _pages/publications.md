- **Tripathi, J. S.**, & Rengifo, E. W. (2022). **The Impact of Fractional Trading on Order Book Dynamics.** <br>
Abstract: We study the impact of fractional trading on the price levels and order book dynamics observed in the market. Fractional trading has been a recent introduction in equities markets on multiple trading platforms, allowing individuals to buy a fraction of a share of stocks or ETFs (exchange-traded funds). Fractional trading, along with the direct and easier access to the markets through commission-less trading apps, can potentially modify the risk appetite of non-professional investors (who are generally myopic and risk-averse) and create opportunities for portfolio creation and diversification, hence increasing the demand for stocks. It can also impact non-professional investors' investment behavior, price levels, and market volatility. Using the Nasdaq data feed at a minute level frequency, we show that there has been a significant increase in the slope of the price-volume structure, and in some cases, there is an increase in the number of steps required to place a limit order after the introduction of fractional trading. Our results suggest that increased demand for stocks led by easiness to trade stocks and fractional trading impact the order book's price formation process and price-volume structure. <br>

- **The Impact of Fractional Trading on Risk Aversion for Non-professional Investors.** (w/ Erick W. Rengifo), 2022. <br>
Presented at: FRL 2022 CEMLA Conference on New Advances in International Finance, Fordham Fall 2021 Finance Workshop, Fordham Spring 2021 Macro/International Finance Workshop <br>
Abstract: We study the impact of fractional trading on non-professional investors' decision-making under uncertainty. Using the expected utility framework, we show that with the recent easiness to trade in stock markets and with the option to buy or sell a fraction of a share of a stock or ETFs (exchange-traded funds), the risk appetite of non-professional investors might have gone up, increasing market participation and demand for stocks. Furthermore, we show that this change in the non-professional investor's risk aversion behavior varies by household income levels. Our results suggest that easy access to trade stocks and fractional trading allows households with lower discretionary income a new tool to diversify their portfolio and participate in the stock markets by investing in different stocks and ETFs while at the same time having a significant impact on the stocks' price levels and price dynamics observed in the markets. <br>

- **Tripathi, J. S.** (2021). **Trade-Growth Nexus: A Study of G20 Countries using Simultaneous Equations Model with Dynamic Policy Simulations.** <br>
Abstract: This paper studies the relationship between trade openness and economic growth for G20 countries using a simultaneous equations model from 2004 to 2019. The model is estimated using a full information maximum likelihood method for the G20 countries. Further, the analysis is also done separately for Advanced and Developing G20 countries. The results suggest that trade is positively related to growth, but it works as a handmaiden rather than a growth engine. Further, we also perform dynamic policy simulations based on the most advocated policies like increasing growth of exports, foreign capital inflows, curbing domestic inflation, etc. We find that these policies are not very effective in increasing the growth rate of the real per capita income.
