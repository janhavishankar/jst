- **Tripathi, J. S.**, and Rengifo, E. W. (2021). **The Impact of Fractional Trading on Risk Aversion for Non-professional Investors.** Submitted, Under Review. <br>
Presented at: Fordham Fall 2021 Finance workshop, Fordham Spring 2021 Macro/International Finance workshop <br>
Abstract: We study the impact of fractional trading on non-professional investors' decision-making under uncertainty. Using the expected utility framework, we show that with the recent easiness to trade in stock markets and with the option to buy or sell a fraction of a share of a stock or ETFs (exchange-traded funds), the risk appetite of non-professional investors might have gone up, increasing market participation and demand for stocks. Furthermore, we show that this change in the non-professional investor's risk aversion behavior varies by household income levels. Our results suggest that easy access to trade stocks and fractional trading allows households with lower discretionary income a new tool to diversify their portfolio and participate in the stock markets by investing in different stocks and ETFs while at the same time having a significant impact on the stocks' price levels and price dynamics observed in the markets. 
- **Tripathi, J. S.** (2021). **Trade-Growth Nexus: A Study of G20 Countries using Simultaneous Equations Model with Dynamic Policy Simulations.** <br>
Abstract: This paper studies the relationship between trade openness and economic growth for G20 countries using a simultaneous equations model from 2004 to 2019. The model is estimated using a full information maximum likelihood method for the G20 countries. Further, the analysis is also done separately for Advanced and Developing G20 countries. The results suggest that trade is positively related to growth, but it works as a handmaiden rather than a growth engine. Further, we also perform dynamic policy simulations based on the most advocated policies like increasing growth of exports, foreign capital inflows, curbing domestic inflation, etc. We find that these policies are not very effective in increasing the growth rate of the real per capita income.
