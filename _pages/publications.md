- **The Impact of Fractional Trading on Risk Aversion for Non-professional Investors.** (w/ Erick W. Rengifo). <br> 
Finance Research Letters 52 (2023): 103547. [[DOI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544612322007231?via%3Dihub)]. [[SSRN WP](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4208358)]. <br>

*Abstract:* We study the impact of fractional trading (FT) on non-professional investors' decision-making under uncertainty. Using the expected utility framework, we show that with the recent easiness to trade in stock markets and with the option to buy or sell a fraction of a share of a stock or ETF (exchange-traded fund), the risk appetite of nonprofessional investors might have gone up, increasing market participation and demand for stocks. Furthermore, we show that this change in the non-professional investor's risk aversion behavior varies by household income levels. Based on constructed probabilities, we estimate that approximately 83 billion dollars have been newly invested in stock market post-FT. Our results suggest that easy access to trade stocks and FT allows households with lower discretionary income a new tool to diversify their portfolio and participate in the stock markets by investing in different stocks and ETFs while at the same time having a significant impact on the stocks' price levels and price dynamics observed in the markets. <br>

- **Bond ETF Performance During the COVID-19 Crisis.** (2022). (w/ Jay Surti). Forthcoming, IMF Working Paper. <br>
*Presented at:* IMF Monetary & Capital Markets Policy Forum <br>
*Abstract:* Arbitrage activity by large banks (called APs) is vital to ensuring efficiency and stability of ETF performance. Exploiting the availability of data for the period of the Covid-19 associated market instability, we analyze and contrast APs’ arbitrage activity in normal versus stressed market conditions for a representative database of passive, fixed income ETFs. We find that APs trade ETF shares and bonds in a manner consistent with the arbitrage incentives predicted by theory, in normal times, for corporate bond ETFs, but not for broad market ETFs. For corporate bond ETFs, these incentives were dented significantly during March-April 2020 resulting in persistent, larger discounts-to-NAV of ETF share prices until the Fed’s policy interventions turned the tide. APs’ incentives to manage bond inflow shocks during this period constitute a key factor generating countervailing incentives, interacting with the liquidity of corporate bond ETFs’ asset portfolios. Our results add to emerging empirical evidence that APs do not trade at a scale necessary to quickly close out price-NAV differentials and also appear to trade in a direction that exacerbates share price discounts-to-NAV during times of stress. We find no significant differences between ETFs that are primarily held by institutional versus retail investors. <br>

- **The Impact of Fractional Trading on Order Book Dynamics.** (2022). (w/ Erick W. Rengifo). [[SSRN WP](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4259584)]. <br>
*Presented at:* Fordham Fall 2022 Finance Workshop <br>
*Abstract:* We study the impact of fractional trading on the price levels and order book dynamics observed in stock markets. Fractional trading has recently been introduced on multiple trading platforms in equities markets, allowing individuals to buy a fraction of a share of stocks or ETFs (exchange-traded funds). Fractional trading, along with direct and easier access to the markets through commission-less trading apps, can potentially modify the risk appetite of non-professional investors (who are generally myopic and risk-averse) and create opportunities for portfolio creation and diversification, hence increasing the demand for stocks. It can also impact non-professional investors' investment behavior, price levels, and market volatility. Using Nasdaq data feed at a minute frequency, we show that there has been a significant increase in the slope of the price-volume structure. In some cases, there is an increase in the number of steps required to place a limit order after the introduction of fractional trading. Our results suggest that increased demand for stocks led by easiness to trade stocks and fractional trading impacts the order book's price formation process and price-volume structure. <br>

- **Trade-Growth Nexus: A Study of G20 Countries using Simultaneous Equations Model with Dynamic Policy Simulations.** (2021). Submitted, Under Review. <br>
*Abstract:* This paper studies the relationship between trade openness and economic growth for G20 countries using a simultaneous equations model from 2004 to 2019. The model is estimated using a full information maximum likelihood method for the G20 countries. Further, the analysis is also done separately for Advanced and Developing G20 countries. The results suggest that trade is positively related to growth, but it works as a handmaiden rather than a growth engine. Further, we also perform dynamic policy simulations based on the most advocated policies like increasing growth of exports, foreign capital inflows, curbing domestic inflation, etc. We find that these policies are not very effective in increasing the growth rate of the real per capita income. <br>
