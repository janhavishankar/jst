- **The Impact of Fractional Trading on Risk Aversion for Non-professional Investors.** (w/ Erick W. Rengifo). [[SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4208358)]. <br> 
Finance Research Letters 52 (2023): 103547. [[DOI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544612322007231?via%3Dihub)]. <br>
*Presented at:* NYSEA 2022 Conference, FRL 2022 CEMLA Conference on New Advances in International Finance, Fordham Fall 2021 Finance Workshop, Fordham Spring 2021 Macro/International Finance Workshop <br>
*Abstract:* We study the impact of fractional trading (FT) on non-professional investors' decision-making under uncertainty. Using the expected utility framework, we show that with the recent easiness to trade in stock markets and with the option to buy or sell a fraction of a share of a stock or ETF (exchange-traded fund), the risk appetite of nonprofessional investors might have gone up, increasing market participation and demand for stocks. Furthermore, we show that this change in the non-professional investor's risk aversion behavior varies by household income levels. Based on constructed probabilities, we estimate that approximately 83 billion dollars have been newly invested in stock market post-FT. Our results suggest that easy access to trade stocks and FT allows households with lower discretionary income a new tool to diversify their portfolio and participate in the stock markets by investing in different stocks and ETFs while at the same time having a significant impact on the stocks' price levels and price dynamics observed in the markets. <br>

- **The Impact of Fractional Trading on Order Book Dynamics.** (2022). (w/ Erick W. Rengifo). [[SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4259584)]. Submitted, Under Review. <br>
*Presented at:* Fordham Fall 2022 Finance Workshop <br>
*Abstract:* We study the impact of fractional trading on the price levels and order book dynamics observed in stock markets. Fractional trading has recently been introduced on multiple trading platforms in equities markets, allowing individuals to buy a fraction of a share of stocks or ETFs (exchange-traded funds). Fractional trading, along with direct and easier access to the markets through commission-less trading apps, can potentially modify the risk appetite of non-professional investors (who are generally myopic and risk-averse) and create opportunities for portfolio creation and diversification, hence increasing the demand for stocks. It can also impact non-professional investors' investment behavior, price levels, and market volatility. Using Nasdaq data feed at a minute frequency, we show that there has been a significant increase in the slope of the price-volume structure. In some cases, there is an increase in the number of steps required to place a limit order after the introduction of fractional trading. Our results suggest that increased demand for stocks led by easiness to trade stocks and fractional trading impacts the order book's price formation process and price-volume structure. <br>
